name: vibo-mcp
description: Access your Vibo (vibodj.com) event music planning via MCP. Use when the user asks about their Vibo events, wedding/event timeline, song requests, playlists, or "do not play" list, or wants to add or like songs, join an event from a share link, or export songs to Spotify/Apple Music. Triggers on phrases like "what's on my Vibo timeline", "add this song to the first dance", "what songs did guests request", "join this Vibo event", or "export our playlist to Spotify". Requires vibo-mcp installed and the vibo server registered (see Setup below).

# vibo-mcp

MCP server for [Vibo](https://vibodj.com) — plan your event music as a host/couple: events, timeline sections, song requests, playlists, and exports, via natural language.

- **npm:** [npmjs.com/package/vibo-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vibo-mcp)
- **Source:** [github.com/chrischall/vibo-mcp](https://github.com/chrischall/vibo-mcp)

## Setup

### Option A — npx (recommended)

Add to `.mcp.json` in your project or `~/.claude/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibo": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "vibo-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "VIBO_EMAIL": "you@example.com",
        "VIBO_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication

Pick one:

- **Email + password (recommended):** set `VIBO_EMAIL` and `VIBO_PASSWORD`. The
  server signs in server-side and manages the token (refreshing as needed).
- **Captured token (for Apple/Google/Facebook accounts):** set
  `VIBO_ACCESS_TOKEN` (and `VIBO_REFRESH_TOKEN`) with values captured from a
  signed-in `web.vibodj.com` session — no password needed.

The server boots without credentials (so it can be installed and probed); the
config error only appears on the first tool call.

## Tools

### Reads
- `vibo_get_me` — your profile (and whether Spotify/Apple Music are connected).
- `vibo_list_events` — your upcoming (or `past:true`) events.
- `vibo_get_event` — full details for one event.
- `vibo_list_sections` — an event's timeline (Ceremony, First Dance, Dinner, …).
- `vibo_get_section_songs` — songs requested in a section, with likes/flags/comments.
- `vibo_list_section_questions` — the DJ's planning questions for a section (type, options, current answer).
- `vibo_search_songs` — find songs to add (Vibo catalog or connected Spotify).
- `vibo_list_section_song_ideas` / `vibo_list_song_ideas_songs` — browse the DJ's suggested song collections per section.

- `vibo_list_event_users` — the hosts and guests on an event.
- `vibo_list_notifications` / `vibo_get_notifications_count`.
- `vibo_healthcheck` — confirm connectivity + auth.

### Writes (confirm-gated)
Each mutating tool makes **no** network call unless `confirm: true`; without it
you get a dry-run preview of exactly what would be sent.

- `vibo_add_song_to_section` — add a searched song to a section.
- `vibo_remove_song_from_section` / `vibo_move_song` / `vibo_reorder_songs`.
- `vibo_update_song` — mark must-play / do-not-play, or set a comment.
- `vibo_toggle_song_like` — like/unlike a song.
- `vibo_comment_on_song` / `vibo_comment_on_section` (+ delete) — leave the DJ notes.
- `vibo_import_playlist_to_section` — pull tracks from a connected Spotify/Apple playlist.
- `vibo_join_event` — join via a share link/hash (e.g. a `vibodj.app.link/...` URL).
- `vibo_leave_event`.
- `vibo_create_event_contact` — add a host/guest contact.
- `vibo_invite_users` / `vibo_change_user_role` / `vibo_remove_user` — manage who's on the event.
- `vibo_update_section` — edit a section's name, time, or note.
- `vibo_answer_question` — answer a planning question (text / option ids / link / image+file uploads).
- `vibo_set_profile_photo` — set your profile photo from a local image.
- `vibo_mark_notifications_read`.
- `vibo_export_event_to_spotify` / `vibo_export_event_to_apple_music`.

## Typical flow

1. `vibo_list_events` → pick an event id.
2. `vibo_list_sections` → pick a section id.
3. `vibo_search_songs` → get a song's `songUrl`/`viboSongId`.
4. `vibo_add_song_to_section` (with `confirm: true`).
